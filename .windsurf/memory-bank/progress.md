# Progress: Current Status and Roadmap

## What Works (Production Ready)
- **Complete Core Features**: All five planned development phases are complete. This includes trade management, advanced forex analytics, risk management tools, and multi-account support.
- **Hybrid Dashboard Architecture**: A robust and user-friendly dashboard is implemented, featuring a static metrics bar and a customizable 2x2 grid for analytical widgets.
- **Unified Widget System**: All dashboard widgets are rendered through a consistent, centralized system (`WidgetWrapper`), ensuring visual and behavioral uniformity.
- **Professional Calendar**: A feature-rich calendar (`react-big-calendar`) is integrated for visualizing daily P&L.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Priorities)
1.  **Finalize Dashboard Polish**: Perform a final review of the new dashboard layout, making minor style adjustments to ensure pixel-perfect alignment and a polished user experience.
2.  **Implement "Empty State"**: Design and add a placeholder component for the customizable grid that appears when a user removes all widgets.

## Known Issues & Technical Debt
- **Mock Data**: The correlation analysis feature currently uses mock data (`Math.random()`) and needs to be connected to a real calculation engine.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Some complex chart components require mobile-specific layouts to ensure proper rendering on smaller screens.
- **API Keys**: The economic calendar requires production-level API keys to be fully functional.
