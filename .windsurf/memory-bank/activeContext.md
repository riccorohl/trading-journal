# Active Context: Current Focus

## 1. Primary Objective
**Finalize and Polish the Hybrid Dashboard**: The immediate goal is to complete the final user experience touches on the newly implemented hybrid dashboard architecture. This involves ensuring the layout is pixel-perfect and handling edge cases like an empty grid.

## 2. Recent Accomplishments
- **Architectural Refactor**: Successfully pivoted from a fully customizable dashboard to a more stable and professional hybrid model (static metrics bar + customizable grid).
- **Unified Widget Rendering**: Implemented a universal `WidgetWrapper` component, which has eliminated visual inconsistencies and centralized widget rendering logic.
- **Professional Calendar Integration**: Replaced a basic calendar with `react-big-calendar`, providing a feature-rich and correctly responsive component for P&L visualization.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Thoroughly Test Layout**: Review the new dashboard's functionality, including resizing, adding, and removing widgets from the customizable grid.
2.  **CSS Polish**: Make minor style adjustments to ensure perfect visual alignment and harmony.
3.  **Create "Empty State"**: Design and implement a placeholder for the customizable grid that appears when all widgets have been removed by the user.

## 4. Guiding Principles
- **Prioritize Robust Architecture**: Continue to favor strong, maintainable foundations over short-term fixes.
- **Maintain High Quality**: Ensure all new implementations meet the project's established standards for quality and user experience.
