# Project Brief: Zella Trade Scribe

## 1. Project Overview
Zella Trade Scribe is a specialized, professional-grade forex trading journal designed to provide institutional-level analytics, risk management, and economic intelligence to retail forex traders. It aims to bridge the gap between expensive professional platforms and overly simplistic trade logs.

## 2. Core Problem
Forex traders currently rely on a fragmented ecosystem of expensive, generic, or inadequate tools. They lack a single, forex-specific platform that integrates trade analysis, risk management, and market intelligence in a cohesive and actionable way.

## 3. Project Goals & Objectives
- **Develop a Centralized Platform**: Create a single source of truth for forex trade tracking, analysis, and risk management.
- **Provide Forex-Specific Analytics**: Implement features that are unique to the forex market, such as currency correlation, pip analysis, and currency strength meters.
- **Integrate Economic Intelligence**: Seamlessly connect economic calendar events and news to trading activity and performance.
- **Deliver Professional-Grade Risk Tools**: Offer sophisticated risk management features like real-time portfolio analysis, leverage calculators, and drawdown analysis.
- **Ensure a High-Quality User Experience**: Build a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface that is powerful for experienced traders yet accessible to newcomers.
- **Maintain a Robust and Maintainable Codebase**: Adhere to best practices, including strict TypeScript typing, a clear architectural pattern (Service Layer, Component Layer), and comprehensive documentation.

## 4. Success Criteria
- **Technical**: A zero-bug, professional-grade application with enterprise-level features.
- **Business**: Ready for premium monetization with professional-tier capabilities.
- **User Experience**: An intuitive interface that enables data-driven trading decisions.
- **Competitive**: Achieves feature parity with premium trading platforms at a fraction of the cost.
