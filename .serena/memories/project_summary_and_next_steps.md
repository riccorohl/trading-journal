## Claudepoint Checkpoint: zella-trade-scribe Project

### Key Files Identified:
- `yahoo-finance-service.js`: This is the main Express.js server file that handles API routing. It is the correct place to add new API endpoints.
- `api/`: This directory was initially thought to be for file-based routing, but this was incorrect. It contained a temporary file I created.

### Changes Made:
1.  A new GET endpoint `/api/prebuilds` was added to `yahoo-finance-service.js`.
2.  The endpoint currently returns a hardcoded empty array `[]` as a placeholder.
3.  The file `api/prebuilds.js` was created but is now redundant. Attempts to delete it failed due to a persistent, unrecoverable shell error.

### Plan for Next Session:
- The immediate next step is to implement the actual logic for the `/api/prebuilds` endpoint. This will likely involve:
    1.  Integrating with the existing authentication service (`src/lib/authService.ts`) to get the current user.
    2.  Interacting with the Firebase service (`src/lib/firebaseService.ts`) to fetch the prebuilds data associated with that user.
- Manually delete the `api/prebuilds.js` file.
