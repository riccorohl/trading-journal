            </div>
          )}

          <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
            {/* Equity Curve */}
```

**Insert Between**: The `</div>` and the `<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">` lines

### üîß READY-TO-INSERT CODE:
The correlation analysis code is prepared and includes:

- **Quick completion**: Phase 2 #5 should be completed within 10-15 minutes in next session

**Next session goal**: Complete Phase 2 #5 Correlation Analysis and begin Phase 3 Risk Management Tools
