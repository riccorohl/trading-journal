# Session 6 - Trade Modal Chart Integration

## What We Accomplished:
- Fixed import error in TradeModal.tsx (replaced invalid `Cancel` icon with `XCircle`)
- Successfully integrated Charts tab functionality into Overview tab
- Added HTF/LTF chart toggle buttons with proper state management
- Reorganized performance metrics into vertical sidebar layout
- Reduced tabs from 4 to 3 (removed separate Charts tab)

## Final Layout Design:
- **Left Side**: Chart section (flex-1) with HTF/LTF toggle
- **Right Side**: Vertical metrics sidebar (320px width) with 3 cards:
  - Performance metrics (P&L, R-Multiple, Return %, Duration)
  - Trade Details (Entry/Exit Price, Quantity, Commission)
  - Timing (Date, Time In/Out, Timeframe)

## Technical Implementation:
- Added `chartType` state: `useState<'HTF' | 'LTF'>('HTF')`
- Button order: LTF first, HTF second (per user preference)
- Responsive design: flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop
- Maintained all existing edit functionality
- Clean chart placeholder with upload capability in edit mode
