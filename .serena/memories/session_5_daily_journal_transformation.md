# Session 5 - Daily Journal Transformation

## What We Accomplished:
- Transformed the Daily Journal from a simple trade log to a comprehensive notebook-style journal
- Created DailyJournalView.tsx with three main sections:
  - Pre-Session Planning (market outlook, news events with impact levels)
  - Trades Executed (clean table showing session trades)
  - Post-Session Review (reflection area with performance metrics)

## Technical Details:
- Fixed syntax errors in DailyJournal.tsx (removed arrow character at line 397)
- Implemented clean UI design matching Gemini's aesthetic
- Added localStorage persistence for journal entries
- Integrated with existing TradeReviewModal for trade details

## Current State:
- Daily Journal opens in full-page view when clicking "Open Day"
- Clean white cards on gray background
- Professional table design with hover effects
- Color-coded news event impact indicators
- Performance metrics cards (Net P&L, Win Rate, Trades Taken)
