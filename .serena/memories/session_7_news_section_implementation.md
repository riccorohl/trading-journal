   - Event cards showing Previous/Forecast/Actual values
   - Sample data integration with planned API integration
   - Statistics dashboard showing event counts by impact level

2. **economicCalendarService.ts** - Service layer for MyFXBook integration
   - XML parsing utilities for MyFXBook response format
   - Date range helper functions (today, week)
   - URL generation for MyFXBook API calls
   - Sample data provider for development
   - TypeScript interfaces for economic events

### Navigation Updates:

3. **Sidebar.tsx** - Added News menu item
