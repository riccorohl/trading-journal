# Active Context: Current Development State

## Current Work Focus
**Primary Objective**: **Hybrid "Fixed + Customizable" Dashboard Architecture**
**Recent Achievement**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full architectural refactor of the dashboard to support a new hybrid layout.
**Previous Achievement**: Unified widget rendering system with a universal `WidgetWrapper`.

## Recent Major Changes

### ðŸŽ‰ **New Hybrid Dashboard Architecture - COMPLETE**
**New Architecture**: Based on user feedback, we have pivoted from a fully customizable widget system to a more stable and user-friendly hybrid model. This new design provides a perfect balance between consistency and personalization.

**Key Architectural Changes**:
- **Static Metrics Bar**: The top of the dashboard now features a dedicated, non-editable section that consistently displays the five core metric widgets (Net P&L, Win Rate, etc.). This ensures at-a-glance data is always available and predictable.
- **Customizable Main Grid**: Below the static bar, a new 2x2 grid houses the four main analytical widgets. This area is fully customizable, allowing the user to resize, rearrange, and swap out the larger, more complex widgets.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The application logic now clearly distinguishes between `metric` widgets and `chart`/`analytic` widgets, enforcing the new layout structure.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `src/components/Dashboard_v2.tsx` - **Major Refactor** - Completely rebuilt to implement the new two-section layout (static bar + dynamic grid).
- `src/lib/widgetRegistry.tsx` - **Major Refactor** - Updated to categorize widgets, define the new default layouts, and add the new `PerformanceChartWidget`.
- `src/components/PerformanceChartWidget.tsx` - **NEW** - A new, professional charting component that displays cumulative P&L over time.
- `src/lib/dashboardService.ts` - **Updated** - The persistence logic was modified to save the layout of *only* the new customizable grid.

**New Capabilities**:
- **Stable & Predictable Layout**: Core metrics are always visible and in the same place.
- **Focused Customization**: The "chaos" of full customization is gone, replaced by a powerful but contained 2x2 grid for deeper analysis.
- **New Performance Chart**: Users can now visualize their account's growth over time.
- **Improved UX**: The dashboard is now more intuitive and less overwhelming, directly addressing user feedback.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Two-Part Rendering**: The `DashboardV2` component now has two distinct rendering sections: a simple map for the static metrics and a full `ResponsiveReactGridLayout` for the main grid.
- **Categorized Widget Registry**: The `widgetRegistry` now uses a `category` property to determine where each widget should be rendered.
- **Targeted Persistence**: The Firebase `dashboardService` is now surgically precise, only saving the layout details for the widgets in the customizable main grid.

### ðŸŽ‰ **Unified Widget Rendering System - COMPLETE**
**New Architecture**: All widgets, regardless of their type or location, are now rendered through a single, intelligent `WidgetWrapper` component.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/WidgetWrapper.tsx` - **NEW** - The universal wrapper that handles all widget rendering logic.
- `src/components/ui/WidgetContainer.tsx` - **Updated** - Enhanced to support edit mode and receive all necessary props from the wrapper.
- `src/lib/widgetRegistry.tsx` - **Major Refactor** - All widget components were refactored to be "pure content," with all container logic (titles, icons, remove buttons) moved into the wrapper system.

**New Capabilities**:
- **100% Consistent UI**: Every widget now has the exact same container, header, and remove button, eliminating all visual inconsistencies.
- **Correct Size Constraints**: The `minSize` and `maxSize` properties are now correctly and reliably enforced for all customizable widgets.
- **Bug Fixes**: The "duplicated title" bug has been completely eliminated.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: The logic for widget chrome is now in one place, making future updates much easier.

### ðŸŽ‰ **Professional Calendar Implementation - COMPLETE**
**New Architecture**: The original, problematic `shadcn/ui` calendar has been completely replaced with the powerful, purpose-built `react-big-calendar` library.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `src/components/CalendarWidget.tsx` - **Complete Rebuild** - The component was rebuilt from scratch to use `react-big-calendar`.
- `package.json` - Added `react-big-calendar`, `moment`, and their associated type definitions.

**New Capabilities**:
- **Robust & Responsive**: The new calendar is fully responsive and correctly fills the entire space of its container, resizing smoothly and predictably.
- **Rich P&L Visualization**: Winning and losing days are now rendered as distinct, color-coded "events" showing the total P&L and trade count for that day.
- **Professional Theming**: The calendar has been custom-styled to perfectly match the clean, modern aesthetic of the `shadcn/ui` design system.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Immediate: Finalize Dashboard Styling & UX**
**Goal**: Polish the new dashboard layout and ensure a flawless user experience.
**Implementation Plan**:
1.  **Review and Refine**: Thoroughly test the new layout, including resizing, adding, and removing widgets in the customizable grid.
2.  **Style Polish**: Make any necessary CSS adjustments to ensure pixel-perfect alignment and visual harmony between the static and dynamic sections.
3.  **Add "Empty State"**: Design a placeholder for the customizable grid for when a user removes all four widgets.

### **Future: Phase 5.2 - Broker Comparison**
**Goal**: Comparative broker analysis and trading cost optimization.
**Implementation Plan**:
1.  Create `src/lib/brokerComparisonService.ts`.
2.  Design and build the broker comparison interface as a new, swappable widget for the main grid.

## Guiding Principles
- **Default to Robust Architecture**: Prioritize building a strong, maintainable foundation over quick, tactical fixes.
- **Transparency in Planning**: Present clear options to ensure alignment, always recommending the path to the highest quality outcome.
- **Trust and Quality**: The primary goal is to deliver the highest quality implementation.
