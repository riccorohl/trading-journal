## Active Technical Decisions

### **Service Architecture Pattern Established**
```typescript
// Standard service class pattern:
class ServiceName {
  private cache: Map<string, any>;
  private apis: ApiConfig[];
  
  async getData(): Promise<DataType[]> {
    // 1. Check cache first
    // 2. Try APIs with rate limiting 
    // 3. Fallback to sample data
    // 4. Comprehensive error handling
  }
}
```

### **Component Integration Patterns**
- Multi-tab interfaces for complex features (4+ tabs standard)
- Real-time data loading with proper loading states
- Professional filtering and sorting capabilities
- Full integration with existing TradeContext
- Responsive design with mobile considerations

### **Current Architecture Decisions**
- **Caching Strategy**: 15-minute timeouts for economic data
- **Rate Limiting**: Conservative 5 requests/minute across all APIs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to sample data with user notifications
- **Data Integration**: Full integration with existing trade context for personalized analysis

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### **Code Style Consistency**
- TypeScript interfaces for all service responses
- Comprehensive error handling with try/catch and fallback data
- Professional UI components using shadcn/ui design system
- Color-coded status indicators throughout (green=good, yellow=caution, red=warning)

### **Development Workflow**
- Always run `npm run lint` before major changes
- Test with actual trade data from TradeContext
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes
- Use descriptive git commit messages for major milestones
- **Always use port 8080 for the dev server. Do not let it stack up.**

### **User Experience Priorities**
- Professional visual design matching existing patterns
- Clear, actionable recommendations based on data
- Intuitive filtering and customization options
- Performance optimization with caching and efficient renders

## Current Learnings and Insights

### **API Integration Lessons**
- Multiple API fallbacks essential for reliability
- Caching critical for performance and rate limit management
- Sample data must be realistic and comprehensive for development

### **Forex-Specific Requirements**
- Currency correlations change throughout trading sessions
- Economic events have different impacts on different pairs
- Risk analysis must account for forex-specific factors (carry trades, interest rates)
- Real-time data is crucial for professional forex analytics

### **Technical Performance**
- Complex charts benefit from React.memo optimization
- Service classes with singleton pattern work well for data management
- Professional UI requires consistent color schemes and visual hierarchy

## Known Immediate Priorities
1. **Phase 5.4 Customizable Dashboard** - Continue implementation of drag-and-drop dashboard.
2. Optimize mobile responsiveness for account management features
3. Consider adding real-time notifications for account performance alerts
